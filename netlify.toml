# The app lives in the frontend/ subdirectory. Backend API is at https://leedsapi.tikuntech.com/api/v1
#
# Deploy from local CLI (run from repo root only):
#   cd /path/to/LeedsCrm
#   netlify login          # once
#   netlify link           # once, link to your site (or netlify init)
#   netlify deploy --prod # build runs on Netlify, then deploy

[build]

  command = "npm run build"

# Required for Next.js: use Netlify's Next.js runtime so routes and SSR work (fixes "Page not found")

  # Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL in Netlify UI: Site settings → Environment variables
